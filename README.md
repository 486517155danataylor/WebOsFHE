### Components

#### 1. WebAssembly FHE Kernel
- Core execution engine for encrypted processes  
- Provides FHE primitives and secure memory management  

#### 2. Encrypted Process Manager
- Runs applications as isolated encrypted processes  
- Manages inter-process communication securely  

#### 3. Virtual Encrypted File System
- Persistent encrypted storage in-browser  
- Supports file I/O without exposing plaintext  

#### 4. Secure Web Application Runtime
- Allows web applications to execute on encrypted data  
- Ensures user interactions remain confidential

## Why FHE Matters

- Traditional browser-based OSes expose memory and computation to attacks  
- FHE enables **computation directly on encrypted data**, preventing leaks  
- Supports a wide range of secure applications: productivity, finance, messaging, and more  
- Ensures strong data isolation without sacrificing usability

---

## Use Cases

1. **Secure Cloud Workspaces**
   - Users can run sensitive applications in-browser without trusting the host  

2. **Privacy-Preserving Collaboration**
   - Team members operate on shared encrypted data securely  

3. **Encrypted Data Analysis**
   - Perform computations on encrypted datasets in-browser  

4. **Secure Web Applications**
   - Protect sensitive user inputs, API calls, and internal computations

## Security Features

- **Encrypted Processes:** All runtime processes encrypted using FHE  
- **Isolated Execution:** Applications cannot access each other's data  
- **Secure Memory:** FHE ensures all in-memory computations remain private  
- **Protected Persistence:** Virtual file system encrypts all stored data

## Advantages

- üîí **End-to-End Privacy:** User data never exposed in plaintext  
- ‚ö° **High Compatibility:** Runs entirely in standard browsers with WebAssembly  
- üñ•Ô∏è **Portable OS Environment:** Access a secure workspace from any device  
- ‚úÖ **Tamper-Resistant:** FHE prevents malicious manipulation of processes or memory
